# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Project
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Life Expectancy and GDP Project, which is a part of the Data Science career path at Codecademy. The project focuses on analyzing the relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and life expectancy in six distinct countries using data from the World Health Organization and the World Bank.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

Calculate the average life expectancy in the six selected countries.
Visualize the life expectancy distribution for each nation.
Analyze trends in life expectancy over a span of 15 years.
Investigate GDP trends over time in these nations.
Determine if there is a correlation between a country's GDP and its life expectancy.
The data sources for this project are as follows:

#### GDP Source: World Bank GDP Data
#### Life Expectancy Data Source: World Health Organization

## Project Files

The repository contains the following files:

#### life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and visualization.
#### data/: Directory containing the dataset files used in the project.
#### README.md: This documentation file.
#### LICENSE: License information for the project.

## Project Execution

To run the analysis and generate the visualizations, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/life-expectancy-and-gdp-project.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd life-expectancy-and-gdp-project

#### Open the Jupyter Notebook life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb using Jupyter or a compatible environment.

#### Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Results and Visualizations

The Jupyter Notebook contains detailed explanations, code, and visualizations of the project's findings. You can explore the visual representations of life expectancy plotted against GDP for each of the six countries, as well as the results of statistical analyses.

## Conclusions

This project aims to answer questions about the relationship between GDP and life expectancy in six countries and provides insights into the changes in life expectancy and GDP over time.
